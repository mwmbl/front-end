		</p>
		<p class="mb-6">
			All user-contributed content, including but not limited to curated search results, domain submissions, and reviews, is made available under the terms of the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)</a>, ensuring continued open access and benefit to the wider community.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-6">
			Data collected through Mwmbl's crawler—such as publicly available metadata, indexing information, and links—is considered part of the curated dataset and is likewise made available under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, unless such use is restricted by applicable law or the rights of third parties.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-6">
			While no financial compensation is provided for contributions or crawled data, Mwmbl acknowledges and deeply values the role of every contributor in building a free and open search ecosystem.
		</p>

		<h3 class="mb-3 mt-6 text-xl font-semibold">Obligations Under Mwmbl's License</h3>
		<p class="mb-4">

		</p>
		<p class="mb-6">
			Failure to comply with these obligations may result in Mwmbl taking legal action to protect its rights, including the enforcement of the AGPL-3.0 license terms.
		</p>

			Mwmbl provides its services "as is" and "as available," without warranties or guarantees regarding the accuracy, availability, or suitability of the services. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Mwmbl disclaims liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from:

			<li>The accuracy or completeness of search results derived from third-party sources.</li>
			<li>Unauthorized access, security breaches, or incidents beyond our reasonable control.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="mb-6">
			Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this disclaimer may not apply to you.
		</p>

		<h3 class="mb-3 mt-6 text-xl font-semibold">Limitation of Liability for Damages</h3>
		<p class="mb-6">
			To the fullest extent permitted by law, Mwmbl and its subsidiaries will not be liable for any indirect, consequential, special, incidental, punitive, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to lost profits, lost savings, or goodwill, regardless of the legal theory (tort, contract, or otherwise), even if Mwmbl has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The maximum liability of Mwmbl will be limited to the amount paid by you for services in the last 12 months, or $100 if you have not paid for services.
		</p>

		<h3 class="mb-3 mt-6 text-xl font-semibold">Force Majeure</h3>
		<p class="mb-6">
			Mwmbl will not be held liable for delays or interruptions caused by events outside our control, including but not limited to natural disasters, technical failures, or governmental actions. We will take reasonable steps to minimize any disruption caused by such events.
		</p>

		<h3 class="mb-3 mt-6 text-xl font-semibold">Third-Party Content</h3>
		<p class="mb-6">
			Mwmbl may provide access to third-party content, including search results and links to external websites. We do not control, endorse, or assume responsibility for such content. Users should be aware that third-party websites may have their own terms of service, and Mwmbl does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or security of any third-party content. If you believe content violates intellectual property rights, please contact the hosting website or service for removal.
		</p>

		<h3 class="mb-3 mt-6 text-xl font-semibold">Changes to These Terms</h3>
		<p class="mb-6">
			Mwmbl reserves the right to modify these Terms and Conditions at any time. Users will be notified of any material changes via the Mwmbl website. Continued use of Mwmbl after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.
		</p>

		<h3 class="mb-3 mt-6 text-xl font-semibold">Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
		<p class="mb-6">
			These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Mwmbl Non-Profit Organization is established, which may include EU, UK, or Swiss law. Any disputes arising from the use of Mwmbl shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the relevant courts in the applicable jurisdiction.
		</p>

		<h3 class="mb-3 mt-6 text-xl font-semibold">Severability</h3>
		<p class="mb-6">
			If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.
